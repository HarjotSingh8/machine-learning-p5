## Instructions

Open this [live link](https://harjotsingh8.github.io/machine-learning-p5/) in your browser to get to a sandbox and refer to these steps if required:

1. In this sandbox you can click anywhere on the grey area to select a starting point for your entities.

2. Once you have selected the starting point, you can click or drag from the area around it to create a path (made of square blocks) for the entities to follow.

###### Setting a starting point and creating a path

3. Once you have created a path, you can click on the start button on top left corner to spawn entities, these entities will learn from performing completely random moves to traversing the path improving slowly generation over generation.
